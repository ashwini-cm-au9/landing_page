How to send file using contextapi and reducer using tus-js-client

To send a file using Context API and Reducer using tus-js-client, you can follow these steps:

Install tus-js-client package:
Copy code
npm install tus-js-client
Create a Context and Reducer for your file uploading state:
javascript
Copy code
import React, { createContext, useReducer } from "react";

const initialState = {
  file: null,
  isUploading: false,
  progress: 0,
  error: null,
};

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_FILE":
      return { ...state, file: action.payload };
    case "SET_UPLOADING":
      return { ...state, isUploading: action.payload };
    case "SET_PROGRESS":
      return { ...state, progress: action.payload };
    case "SET_ERROR":
      return { ...state, error: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export const UploadContext = createContext();

export const UploadProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <UploadContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </UploadContext.Provider>
  );
};
Create a component to handle the file upload:
javascript
Copy code
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import tus from "tus-js-client";
import { UploadContext } from "./UploadContext";

const FileUploader = () => {
  const { state, dispatch } = useContext(UploadContext);

  const handleFileChange = (event) => {
    const file = event.target.files[0];
    dispatch({ type: "SET_FILE", payload: file });
  };

  const handleUpload = () => {
    const file = state.file;
    if (!file) {
      dispatch({ type: "SET_ERROR", payload: "No file selected" });
      return;
    }

    const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
      endpoint: "http://example.com/files/",
      chunkSize: 5242880,
      retryDelays: [0, 3000, 5000, 10000, 20000],
      metadata: {
        filename: file.name,
        filetype: file.type,
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        dispatch({ type: "SET_ERROR", payload: error });
      },
      onProgress: (bytesUploaded, bytesTotal) => {
        const progress = (bytesUploaded / bytesTotal) * 100;
        dispatch({ type: "SET_PROGRESS", payload: progress });
      },
      onSuccess: () => {
        dispatch({ type: "SET_UPLOADING", payload: false });
      },
    });

    upload.start();
    dispatch({ type: "SET_UPLOADING", payload: true });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} />
      <button onClick={handleUpload}>Upload</button>
      {state.isUploading && <div>Uploading... {state.progress}%</div>}
      {state.error && <div>Error: {state.error.message}</div>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default FileUploader;
Wrap your component with the UploadProvider:
javascript
Copy code
import React from "react";
import FileUploader from "./FileUploader";
import { UploadProvider } from "./UploadContext";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <UploadProvider>
      <FileUploader />
    </UploadProvider>
  );
};

export default App

React ContextAPI with Reducer - File Upload

Using contextapi reducer how to send file in react

The Context API in React is a way to share data between components without passing the data through props. A reducer is a function that takes in a state and an action, and returns a new state based on the action.

To send a file using the Context API with a reducer in React, you can follow these steps:

Define an initial state with an empty file object in your reducer function. For example:
php
Copy code
const initialState = {
  file: null
};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_FILE":
      return { ...state, file: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
Create a new context using the createContext function and pass in the initialState and the reducer. For example:
javascript
Copy code
export const FileContext = createContext(initialState);

export const FileProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <FileContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </FileContext.Provider>
  );
};
Create a file input in your component and set an onChange event that dispatches a SET_FILE action to the reducer. For example:
javascript
Copy code
import { useContext } from "react";
import { FileContext } from "./FileContext";

function FileUploader() {
  const { dispatch } = useContext(FileContext);

  const handleFileUpload = (event) => {
    dispatch({ type: "SET_FILE", payload: event.target.files[0] });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="file" onChange={handleFileUpload} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default FileUploader;
Access the file object in any component that needs it by using the useContext hook and passing in the FileContext. For example:
javascript
Copy code
import { useContext } from "react";
import { FileContext } from "./FileContext";

function FilePreview() {
  const { state } = useContext(FileContext);

  return (
    <div>
      {state.file && (
        <img src={URL.createObjectURL(state.file)} alt="file preview" />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default FilePreview;
In this example, the FilePreview component displays the file that was uploaded in the FileUploader component by accessing the file object in the state object of the FileContext.

Note: When sending a file to a server, you would typically need to use additional APIs or libraries such as FormData or axios to actually upload the file. The above code only demonstrates how to use the Context API and reducer to manage the state of a file object in your React application.
